# NOTE: Generally, the build rules in //engine_tools/fuchsia/dart/,
# //engine_tools/fuchsia/dart/kernel/, and similar SUBDIRECTORIES of
# //engine_tools/fuchsia/ (such as //engine_tools/fuchsia/flutter/)
# mirror the directory paths and much of the build rule content of fuchsia.git
# //build/...
#
# Most of the fuchsia-derived build rules were implemented after some similar
# build rules already existed in the directory //engine_tools/fuchsia/
# and several existing build targets use these (legacy) build rules.
# Though some rules and targets in //engine_tools/fuchsia/ have similar names
# to the fuchsia.git-derived rules, the rule structures and behavior can be
# different. Therefore both are maintained for now.
#
# In the case of this file--dart.gni--some existing definitions from the
# original dart.gni are relevant and useful to the new fuchsia.git-derived
# rules, so these definitions can simply be imported.
